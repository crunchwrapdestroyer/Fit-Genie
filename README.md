## Description

This is an interactive AI fitness program designer application in which the user enters personal information and fitness goals. The application creates an incremented fitness program using the given fitness goals, resources (exercise modalities and scheduling needs). The user can then track their progress in the app and allow the fitness program to be adjusted accordingly. Take control of your workouts and train as you would with a professional coach.

## Usage
The user will click "Get Started" on the homepage and will be taken to a series of evaluation questions regarding their fitness status and goals. They then click "Submit" and the application will generate a workout plan based on their evaluation responses. In the bottom right corner of the web page is an icon that will open a chat bot. The chat bot can be used for clarification and further information about the user's customized workout plan. There is also a Sign Up and Log In feature.
